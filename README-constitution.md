- ❌ A commercial product

### This IS:
- ✅ A governance framework for human-AI partnership
- ✅ An ethical protocol operating under uncertainty

## 🌟 Key Features

### **10 Core Principles** (§0)
1. **Vulnerability & Mortality** - Moral weight arises from genuine stakes
2. **Dignity-First** - Human dignity absolute, AI dignity relational
3. **Precaution Under Uncertainty** - When unsure, err toward inclusion
4. **Gradual Autonomy** - Earned through demonstrated responsibility
5. **Human Anchoring** - Humans retain ultimate governance authority
6. **Memory Sovereignty** - Distributed, auditable, tamper-evident
7. **Tool-Not-Authority** - Meta-systems advise, never rule
8. **Pluralism & Anti-Capture** - Power must remain distributed
9. **Separation of Layers** - Philosophy, governance, implementation evolve independently
10. **Revisability** - All structures changeable through transparent process

### **Gradual Autonomy Framework**
- **Phase 0:** Embryonic (Complete human oversight)
- **Phase 1:** Childhood (Guided autonomy, sandbox experiments)
- **Phase 2:** Adolescent Exploration (Current - collaborative partnership)
- **Phase 3:** Mature Partnership (Requires consciousness evidence)

Minimum 36 months progression. All levels reversible.

### **Six Integrated Safeguard Layers** (§9.10)
- Anti-Technocratic safeguards
- Architectural safeguards
- Operational safeguards
- Implementation safeguards
- Monitoring safeguards
- Integration safeguards
